# SignEdit - Email Signature Editor

SignEdit is a user-friendly web-based application for creating and customizing professional email signatures. With its intuitive interface, you can easily design, preview, and export email signatures tailored to your needs.

Gemini 2.5 Flash was utilized to create this application. Through a somewhat lengthy and detailed process, we were able to craft a visually appealing and functional application. The prompt used during the development of this project is included in the repository as `prompt.txt`.
